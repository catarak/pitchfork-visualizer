#Pitchfork Visualizer

Hopefully you're familiar with [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/), the most influential music blog on the Internet. I love reading their reviews, despite the fact that I don't always agree with them. The part I find frustrating about their website is that their data is obscured--it's easy to find an individual review, but it's hard to visiualize it in context of the rest of the website. I wanted to create a visualization to explore favorite albums and artists of Pitchfork, as well as expose biases.

In order to grab all of this data, I forked a scraper I found and put it on [Morph.io](https://morph.io/), a website that calls itself "the Heroku of scrapers." You can then access the review data using an [API that is configred for you](https://morph.io/documentation/api?scraper=catarak%2Fpitchfork_review_data). It's pretty awesome.
